# 🚀 CodeCandid  
**A Glass-Box Algorithm Learning & Simulation Platform**

> *See algorithms think.*

---

## 📌 Overview

**CodeCandid** is an interactive algorithm learning and simulation platform designed to make algorithms **transparent, explainable, and intuitive**.

Instead of treating algorithms as black boxes that magically produce outputs, CodeCandid exposes their **internal execution flow**, enabling learners to observe how data, variables, and states evolve at every step.

The platform follows a **glass-box learning approach**, empowering students to build deep conceptual understanding through visualization, exploration, and guided execution.

---

## 🎯 Problem We Address

Learning algorithms is often difficult because:
- Execution happens mentally or on paper  
- Internal states are hidden  
- Students memorize rather than understand  
- Debugging logic flow feels abstract  

Traditional tools focus on results, not reasoning.

---

## 💡 Our Approach

CodeCandid bridges this gap by allowing users to:
- Visualize algorithm execution step-by-step  
- Inspect intermediate states and decisions  
- Navigate forward and backward through execution  
- Learn at their own pace with guided assistance  

This transforms algorithm learning into an **interactive, experience-driven process**.
